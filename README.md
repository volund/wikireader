# Wikireader - Dictionary Enabled Wikipedia Reader

Wikireader is a website reader with a built in dictionary, primarily
targeted at reading wikipedia.

## Installation (Android only)

Find it on the play store: [Wikireader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.putskul_productions.wikireader)

Or clone and build it from source. 


## Usage

Upon installation the app shows a screen that allows one to select the
languages they'd like to read in. Tapping the check box activates a
language and will prompt the user to select which languages they'd
like to translate to. Tapping the language itself will show a list of
websites to show for that language.

Once setup is complete, tap the globe icon in the top-left to select a
website. While reading e.g. wikipedia, double-tap a word to see its
definition in the dictionary.

This is a side-project and still has some rough edges.
